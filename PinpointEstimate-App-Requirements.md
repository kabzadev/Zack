# Pinpoint Estimating App - Requirements Document

## Overview
A mobile/web app for on-site painting estimates that eliminates the complexity of square-foot pricing while capturing all the variables that matter.

## Core Features

### 1. Quick Labor Calculation
- **Billing rate input** — Set your hourly rate
- **Crew size** — Number of painters
- **Days estimate** — Based on 8-hour workdays
- **Auto-tabulation** — Instant labor cost calculation

### 2. Material Calculator
- **Core product pricing** — Sherwin-Williams / PPG products
- **Gallons input** — Enter by specific areas (exterior, trim, doors, etc.)
- **Quick-add** — Common product presets

### 3. Smart Estimation (No Square-Foot BS)
- **Experience-based input** — "We know it when we see it"
- **Variable complexity handling** — 3-story dormers, mullions, mantels
- **No rigid formulas** — Every house is different

### 4. Customer Integration
- **House photo upload** — Store customer photos with estimates
- **Color selection** — Sherwin-Williams color picker integration
- **Visualization** — Auto-apply selected colors to house photos (stretch goal)

### 5. Input Methods
- **Voice input** — "Seven guys, four days, 15 gallons exterior..."
- **Quick type entry** — Fast numeric inputs
- **Template-based** — Start from common estimate structures

## Estimate Structure (Based on PDF)
1. Customer info (name, address, phone, email)
2. Project description & exclusions
3. Preparation details (interior/exterior)
4. Paint & finishes (products, colors, coats)
5. Pricing level (Best/Better/Good)
6. Add-ons (carpentry, wallpaper removal, etc.)
7. Payment terms
8. Warranty & conditions

## Technical Considerations
- Works offline on job sites
- Exports to PDF (like current template)
- Customer signature capture
- Photo storage & organization
- Cloud sync for team access

## Why Not Square-Foot?
> "Every house is different... three-story dormers, mullions, mantons. You can't bet on square foot like that."

The app focuses on **time + materials** based on expert assessment, not automated calculations that miss the nuance.
